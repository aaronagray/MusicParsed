  <h1>Playing and singing at the same time</h2>
<p>Playing and singing at the same time requires a lot of practice and coordination.</p>
<p>Make sure you’re playing and singing in the same key.</p>
<ul>
<li>This requires finding the starting note for singing the song. Eventually, you’ll be able to do so by ear - after playing a few chords in the song, you’ll just “know” what to sing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, if you can’t do this yet, try matching a recording.
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice just playing. Get comfortable transitioning between chords with your left hand and strumming with your right hand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Play along with a Youtube video. You can slow it down to 0.5 speed.</li>
</ul>

<li>I post some covers and song chords.
<ul>
<li>Sing only a couple of words of the song while playing.</li>
</ul>
