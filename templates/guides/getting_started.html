<h1>Practice ukulele</h1>
<h2>Before playing</h2>
<p>Tune the ukulele before playing. This ensures that the chords are accurate. If you don’t trust your ear yet, I recommend a tuner where you play the ukulele string and the tuner visually shows you how high/low you are.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I like the free phone app <a href="" target="_blank">Pitched Tuner</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also have a clip on tuner which works by detecting vibrations through the ukulele body. You can buy one separately for ~$10. Mine came with the <a href="" target="_blank">Donner ukulele set</a>.
  <p>For tuning by ear, I use <a href="" target="_blank">UkuTuner</a>.</p>
  <p>Hold the ukulele correctly. You can check Youtube for tutorials.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Learn chords</h2>
  <p>Much of learning ukulele is learning how to play chords. A <strong>chord</strong> is several notes played at once. Each string is a separate note.</p>
  <p>To play a chord, hold down frets with your left hand and strum all four strings with your right hand. Holding down frets shortens strings, produces different notes, and allows you to play different chords. (Side note: You can play the Am7 chord without holding down any frets since the ukulele is tuned G, C, E, A, and the notes in the Am7 chords are G, C, E, A.)</p>
  <p>I recommend starting with these 4 chords: Am, C, F, G. This allows you to play most pop songs! Here’s more info on the <a href="" target="_blank">basic music theory for understanding pop songs</a>.</p>
  <p>Here are the chord diagrams:</p>
  <p><img /></p>
  <p>The thick black line represents the top of the ukulele, and the dots are where you put your fingers on the fretboard.</p>
  <p>Here’s how I play the chords:</p>
  <p>Am: Middle finger on the second fret of the G string.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using middle finger here makes the Am - F transition easy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>C: Ring finger on the third fret of the A string.</p>
  <p>F: Middle finger on the second fret of the G string, index finger on the first fret of the E string.</p>
  <p>G: Index finger on C string, ring finger on E string, middle finger on A string.</p>
  <p>These chords are easy on the ukulele because of how it’s tuned. If you’re starting with a baritone ukulele or a guitar, I recommend starting with these 4 chords instead: Em, G, C, D.</p>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3>Weird chords</h3>
  <p>You can add notes to basic chords to make them more complex. This results in chord names such as Cadd9 or Cm7. The song will still sound okay if you ignore the additional complexity. Make sure to pay attention to whether the chord is major or minor. For example, you can play C instead of Cadd9 and Cm instead of Cm7.</p>
  <p>You might also see a / in the chord name such as G/B. Just ignore the note after the slash. It’s the bass note.</p>
  <h3>Transposing</h3>
  <p>When you look up song chords, you’ll often see a transpose feature. To <strong>transpose</strong> means to play in a different key. This makes a song higher or lower to sing and changes the chords.</p>
  <p>Here are some common use cases for transposing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a song is out of your vocal range, transposing a song makes it easier to sing.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>If the chords are too hard on the ukulele, transposing a song makes it easier to play.</li>
<li>If you want to play along to a recording, you might have to transpose to get the right key.
  <h3>Capo</h3>
  <p>You might also see “CAPO 1”. A <strong>capo</strong> is a device you clamp onto your ukulele to shorten all of the strings. The number indicates which fret you should put the capo on.</p>
  <p>Capos allow you to use easy finger positions to play tricky chords. Suppose a song has the chords Am, F, C, G and says capo 1.</p>
  <p>If you have a capo, put the capo on the first fret. Pretend that the capo is the top of the ukulele, and play the chords relative to there. Because the capo keeps all of the strings shortened, you are actually playing A#m, F#, C#, G#.</p>
  <p>Putting the capo on the first fret is the same as transposing by +1. If you don’t have a capo and you want to play in the same key, you can just play the chords A#m, F#, C#, G#.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <h2>Strum patterns</h2>
  <p>Song chords indicate when to transition between chords, but usually don’t specify how to play the chords on the right hand. I recommend using a strum pattern.</p>
  <p>A <strong>strum pattern</strong> is a regularly repeating sequence that you play independently of the singing. The most important step is developing a sense of rhythm. Learn how to count, and start simple.</p>
  <p>Suppose that the chords transition every 4 beats. The simplest strum pattern you can play is to strum down (D) once for every new chord. Other simple strum patterns are strumming every 2 beats and strumming every beat.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>D D</li>
    <li>D D D D</li>
    <li>D D D D D D D D</li>
  </ol>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>You can also learn how to strum up (U). I strum down with the nail on my index finger and up with the fleshy part of the finger.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDU</li>
    <li>D DUD DUD DUD DU</li>
    <li>D DU UDUD DU UDU
      <ul>
        <li>This is the island strum and takes a while to master.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Playing + singing</h2>
      <p>Playing and singing at the same time requires a lot of practice and coordination.</p>
      <p>Make sure you’re playing and singing in the same key.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This requires finding the starting note for singing the song. Eventually, you’ll be able to do so by ear - after playing a few chords in the song, you’ll just “know” what to sing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>However, if you can’t do this yet, try matching a recording.
      <p>Here are some tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice just playing. Get comfortable transitioning between chords with your left hand and strumming with your right hand.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Play along with a Youtube video. You can slow it down to 0.5 speed.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="" target="_blank">Cynthia Lin</a> has lots of ukulele tutorials.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I post some covers and song chords.
      <ul>
        <li>Sing only a couple of words of the song while playing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Song recommendations</h2>
      <p>Here’s my <a href="" target="_blank">song collection</a>.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned before, you can play most pop songs with just Am, C, F, G. Here’s a <a href="" target="_blank">list of four chord songs</a> ordered by chord progression. You might have to transpose the songs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="" target="_blank">Riptide</a> - Am, G, C</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="" target="_blank">Viva la Vida</a> - F, G, C, Am</li>
    <li>
      <a href="" target="_blank">Pompeii</a> +5 - F, C, Am, G
      <p>Side note: The Roman numerals indicate the relationships between the chords. In the key of C major, the I chord is C, the IV chord is F, the V chord is G, and the vi chord is Am. The entire song “Viva la Vida” is F, G, C, Am (IV V I vi).</p>
