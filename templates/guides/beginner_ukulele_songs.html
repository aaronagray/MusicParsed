  Google title. MusicParsed has a collection, and I'm happy to add more songs.
  <p>Here’s my <a href="" target="_blank">song collection</a>.</p>
  <p>(link here: /guides/beginner_ukulele_chords) As I mentioned before, you can play most pop songs with just Am, C, F, G. 

    Here’s a <a href="" target="_blank">list of four chord songs</a> ordered by chord progression. You might have to transpose the songs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="" target="_blank">Riptide</a> - Am, G, C</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="" target="_blank">Viva la Vida</a> - F, G, C, Am</li>
  <li>
    <a href="" target="_blank">Pompeii</a> +5 - F, C, Am, G
    <p>Side note: The Roman numerals indicate the relationships between the chords. In the key of C major, the I chord is C, the IV chord is F, the V chord is G, and the vi chord is Am. The entire song Viva la Vida is F, G, C, Am (IV V I vi).</p>
