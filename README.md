### Speech Recognition
- [3/27] Scrolls down if user says "please"; currently acts as a command
- [3/27] Will probably need each line of chords to be in a separate div (with different tags?) in order to highlight/scroll dynamically

### Gaze Tracking
- [3/27] Calibrate: Click a few times, following your mouse with your eyes.
- [3/27] Look at bottom of page, and then page will scroll automatically
