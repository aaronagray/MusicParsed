A               G                      F# 
I'm sick of picking the pieces 
       F             E             Bb     A 
And second guessing my reasons  
                G                  
Why you don't trust me  
F#      F             E            Bb              A 
Why must we do this to one another 

A               G                      F# 
We are just passionate lovers 
   F             E             Bb     A 
With trouble under the covers 
          G  
Nothing worse than when 
       F             E 
You know that it's over 

 Em                D 
I just need a little of your time 
Bm 
A little of your time 
A 
To say the words I never said 
Em                 D 
I just need a little of your time 
Bm 
A little of your time 
A 
To show you that I am not dead 
G                     Bb                  Bm 
Please don't leave, stay in bed 
               C#m 
Touch my body instead 
Em                          
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 
Em 
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 

Repete intro  

A               G                      F# 
Well I got nothing to hide 
 F             E             Bb     A 
Dip down and come for a ride 
               G          
Embrace a devil so sly 
F#      F             E            Bb              A 
You can not hear 'em coming 

A               G                      F# 
'Cause my defences are weak 
 F             E             Bb     A 
I have no breath left to speak 
         G  
So take the evidence 
      F                    E 
And bury it somewhere 

Em                 D 
I just need a little of your time 
Bm 
A little of your time 
A 
To say the words I never said 
Em                 D 
I just need a little of your time 
Bm 
A little of your time 
A 
To show you that I am not dead 
G                     Bb                  Bm 
Please don't leave, stay in bed 
               C#m 
Touch my body instead 
Em 
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it? 
Em 
Gonna make you feel it 
F# 
Can you still feel it?
