Gm         Bb

Gm                 Bb
but breathing gets harder
     Dm       F

Gm                Bb

Pre-Chorus:
Gm           Am
blank stares at blank pages

Verse 2 - Same as Verse 1 -
i learned the hard way
that they all say
things you wanna hear
and my heavy heart
sings deep down under you
and your twisted words
your help just hurts
you were not what i thought you were
hello to high and dry
 
 
Pre-Chorus:
convinced me to please you
made me think that i need this too
i'm trying to let you hear me as i am
 
 
Chorus:
i'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
i'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's
make or break in this
if your on your way
i'm not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leavin' im'a need a better reason
to write you a love song today

Dm      Am      Bb

Dm         Am      Bb
to help me see
                  F      C

Dm       A            Bb
'cause i believe there's a way
