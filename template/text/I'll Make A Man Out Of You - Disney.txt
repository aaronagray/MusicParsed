[Verse 1]

Em          D/F#    G
Let's get down to business
D/F#  G  Am         D
To    de-feat the Huns
Em       D/F#      G
Did they send me daughters
D/F#  G  Am        D/F#
When  I  asked for sons?


[Chorus]

           C/E             D/F#
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
            G                C
But you can bet before we're through
        C           D           Em      D   Em
Mister, I'll make a man out of you


[Verse 2]

Em         D/F#  G
Tranquil as a  forest
D/F#  G   Am       D
But   on  fire within
Em       D/F#      G
Once you find your center
D/F#  G   Am      D/F#
you   are sure to win


[Chorus]

         C/E             D/F#
You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot
        G              C
And you haven't got a clue
        C           D           Em   D  
Somehow I'll make a man out of you

C               D
I'm never gonna catch my breath
B/D#                       Em
Say good-bye to those who knew me
D/F#                  G                  C
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym
C               D
This guy's got 'em scared to death
B/D#                       Em
Hope he doesn't see right through me
D/F#              G                  C
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim


[Chorus 2]

    D   C/E           D/F#         B/D#     Em 
(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing ri-ver
    G     C/E           D/F#       B/D#    
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
 Em      C/E            D/F#          B/D#   Em
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
  C                  D/F#         
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon


[Verse 3]

Fm       D#/G      G#
Time is racing toward us
D#/G  G#  A#m     D#
till  the Huns arrive
Fm     D#/G    G#
Heed my every order
D#/G  G#  A#m       D#
and   you might survive


[Chorus 3]

       C#                D#/G
You're unsuited for the rage of war
        G#                 C#
So pack up, go home you're through
                   D#         Fm    
How could I make a man out of you?


[Chorus 2]

 C# D#  C#/F           D#          C/E      Fm 
(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing ri-ver
    G#    C#             D#         C/E    
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
 Fm      C#              D#            C/E    Fm
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
  C#                  D#           Fm  Fm
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
