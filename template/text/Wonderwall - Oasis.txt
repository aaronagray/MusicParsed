[Intro]

Em  G   D       A        Em  G   D       A       


[Verse 1]

Em       G
Today is gonna be the day
             D                      A     
That they're gonna throw it back to you,
Em         G
By now you should of somehow
   D                    A     
Realised what you gotta do.
Em                   G       D               A     
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          C     D      A      
About you now.


[Verse 2]

Em             G
Back beat, the word is on the street
         D                     A     
That the fire in your heart is out,
Em              G
I'm sure you've heard it all before,
        D                  A     
But you never really had a doubt.
Em                   G       D               A     
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Em  G   D     A      
About you now.


[Bridge]

    C                D                Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
    C                   D                 Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding,
C              D                   G                  
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      G          A     
But I don't know how.


[Chorus]

        C      Em    G
Because maybe,
       Em                    C         Em  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em    C      Em    G
And after all,
          Em    C      Em    G Em      A      
You're my wonderwall.


[Verse 3]

Em        G
Today was gonna be the day,
            D                      A     
But they'll never throw it back to you,
Em         G
By now you should have somehow
   D                        A     
Realised what you're not to do.
Em                   G       D               A     
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
          Em   G     D     A       
About you now.


[Bridge 2]

    C                   D                 Em
And all the roads that lead you there are winding,
    C                   D                 Em
And all the lights that light the way are blinding,
C              D                   G                  
There are many things that I would like to say to you
      G          A     
But I don't know how.


[Chorus 2]

        C      Em    G
I said maybe,
       Em                    C         Em    G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em    C      Em    G
And after all,
          Em    C      Em    G Em   
You're my wonderwall.


[Chorus 3]

        C      Em    G
I said maybe,
       Em                    C         Em    G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
    Em    C      Em    G
And after all,
          Em    C      Em    G Em  
You're my wonderwall.


[Outro]

        C      Em    G
I said maybe,
       Em                    C         Em    G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       Em                    C         Em    G
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
       Em                    C         Em    G Em  
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
