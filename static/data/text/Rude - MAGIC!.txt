Gb          Ab                    Bbm              Bbm 
Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
Gb          Ab                    Bbm              Bbm 
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
Gb          Ab                    Db              Bbm
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand To ask you a question 
Gb          Ab                    Db              Bbm
Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man yeah yeah 
 
Pre-Chorus:
 Gb                                Ab
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? 
     Db/F                  Bbm
say yes, say yes, Cause I need to know 
Gb                                Ab
You say I'll never get your blessings till the day I die 
     Db                    Bbm
Tough luck my friend but the answer is no!
 
Chorus:
 Gb             Ab          Db              Bbm
