[Anna]
Okay, can I just, say something crazy?

[Hans]
I love crazy!

[Anna]
       D               F#m          G         A
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
         D           F#m       G       A
And then suddenly I bump into you

[Hans]
I was thinking the same thing! 'Cause like
D                   F#m              G           A
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
          D              F#m              Bm          A
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
[Anna] *giggles*

                Bm
[Anna] But with you 
[Hans] But with you
               D
[Hans] I found my place 
[Anna] I see your face

[Both]
         E                              G7
And it's nothing like I've ever known before
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                D   F#m  E  G7
Love is an open door
                D
Love is an open door
            F#m            
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!
            E
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!

[Both]
G7              D   F#m  G  A
Love is an open door

[Instrumental]
D   F#m   G   A

                   E
[Hans] I mean it's crazy
[Anna] What?

          G#m                  A        
[Hans] We finish each other's... 
       B
[Anna] Sandwiches! 
[Hans] That's what I was gonna say!

           E
[Anna] I've never met someone

[Both]
    G#m                 A    B
Who thinks so much like me
    E               G#m
Our mental synchronization
    A                 B
Can have but one explanation
       E         
[Hans] You 
[Anna] and I
       G#m
[Hans] were 
[Anna] just

                A   B
[Both] Meant to be

               C#m
[Anna] Say goodbye 
[Hans] Say goodbye

[Both]
        E
To the pain of the past
F#                          A7
We don't have to feel it anymore
[Chorus]
                E   G#m  F#  A7
Love is an open door
                E   G#m  F#  A7
Love is an open door
                    E
Life can be so much more
            G#m            
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!
            F#
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!

[Both]
A7              E
Love is an open door

[Hans] Can I say something crazy?
[Anna] *giggles*
[Hans] Will you marry me?
[Anna] Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
