[Anna] Okay, can I just, say something crazy?

[Hans] I love crazy!

[Verse 1]
              D               F#m          G         A
[Anna] All my life has been a series of doors in my face
         D               F#m       G       A
And then suddenly I bump into you

[Hans] I was thinking the same thing! 'Cause like
D                   F#m              G           A
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
          D              F#m              Bm          A
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
[Anna] *giggles*

[Pre-Chorus]
                Bm
[Anna] But with you 
[Hans] But with you
               D
[Hans] I found my place 
[Anna] I see your face

[Chorus]
                E                              G7
[Both] And it's nothing like I've ever known before
                D   F#m  E  
Love is an open door
G7              D   F#m  E  
Love is an open door
G7              D
Love is an open door
            F#m            
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!
            E
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!

       G7              D   F#m  G  A
[Both] Love is an open door

[Instrumental]
D   F#m   G   A

[Verse 2]
                   E
[Hans] I mean it's crazy
[Anna] What?

          G#m                          
[Hans] We finish each other's... 
       A
[Anna] Sandwiches! 
                   B
[Hans] That's what I was gonna say!

                  E
[Anna] I've never met someone

           G#m                 A    B
[Both] Who thinks so much like me
    E               G#m
Our mental synchronization
    A                 B
Can have but one explanation
       E         
[Hans] You 
[Anna] and I
[Hans] were 
       G#m
[Anna] just
                A   B
[Both] Meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
               C#m
[Anna] Say goodbye 
[Hans] Say goodbye

              E
[Both] To the pain of the past
F#                          A7
We don't have to feel it anymore

[Chorus]
                       E   G#m  F#  
[Both] Love is an open door
A7              E   G#m  F#  
Love is an open door
A7                  E
Life can be so much more
            G#m            
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!
            F#
[Anna] With you!
[Hans] With you!

       A7              E
[Both] Love is an open door

[Hans] Can I say something crazy?
[Anna] *giggles*
[Hans] Will you marry me?
[Anna] Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
