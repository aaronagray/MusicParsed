Intro: 
A   Gbm  D  A
 
Verse:
A
White lips, pale face,
                     Gbm
Breathing in snowflakes,
           D           A
Burnt lungs, sour taste.
A
Light's gone, day's end,
                    Gbm
Struggling to pay rent,
          D             A
Long nights, strange men.
 
Chorus:
Bm7                             D
And they say she's in the Class a Team,
                A
Stuck in her daydream,
                    E                  Bm7
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                  D
Slowly sinking, wasting,
                A
Crumbling like pastries,
 A
And they scream,
E
The worst things in life come free to us,
Gbm                       D       
Cos we're just under the upperhand,
A
And go mad for a couple of grams,
Gbm                    D          A
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
       Gbm                       D
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
    A
Or sells love to another man,
Gbm         D
It's too cold outside,
A              Gbm
For angels to fly,
E          Gbm 
Angels to fly,
 
Verse:
A
Ripped gloves, raincoat,
                           Gbm
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
         D           A 
Dry house, wet clothes.
 
Loose change, bank notes,
                    Gbm
Weary-eyed, dry throat,
        D          A
Call girl, no phone.
 
Chorus:
Bm7                             D
And they say she's in the Class a Team,
                A
Stuck in her daydream,
                    E                  Bm7
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                  D
Slowly sinking, wasting,
                A
Crumbling like pastries,
 A
And they scream,
E
The worst things in life come free to us,
Gbm                       D       
Cos we're just under the upperhand,
A
And go mad for a couple of grams,
Gbm                    D          A
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
       Gbm                       D
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
    A
Or sells love to another man,
Gbm         D
It's too cold outside,
A              Gbm
For angels to fly,
E          Gbm 
Angels to fly,
Bm7           D
An angel will die.
 
Bridge:
A            E
Covered in white,
Gbm
Closed eye,
     D            A
And hoping for a better life,
Bm                         D
This time, we'll fade out tonight,
A                   Gbm
Straight down the line.
 
 
Chorus:
Bm7                             D
And they say she's in the Class a Team,

Stuck in her daydream,
                    E                  Bm7
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                  D
Slowly sinking, wasting,
                A
Crumbling like pastries,

It's too cold outside,
A              Gbm
For angels to fly,
E          Gbm 
Angels to fly,
D         Gbm
To fly, fly,
A        Gbm       E        Gbm
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly,
A          Gbm
Angels to die.
