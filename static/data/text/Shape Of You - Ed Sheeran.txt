Intro x2: 
Dbm Gbm A B
 
Verse:
    Dbm                 Gbm
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
       A              B
So the bar is where I go
Dbm                      Gbm
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
         A               B
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
     Dbm                       Gbm
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    A                       B
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Dbm                    Gbm
Took my hand, stop, prepare "The man" on the jukebox
    A                B
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
 
Pre-Chorus:
Dbm              Gbm
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 Dbm
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             Gbm
Come on now, follow my lead
A               B    
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
Dbm              Gbm
Boy, let's not talk too much
A                    B                Dbm
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             Gbm
Come on now, follow my lead
A
Come—come on now, follow my lead
 
Chorus:
Dbm      Gbm                    A
  I'm in love with the shape of you
            B                  Dbm
We push and pull like a magnet do
            Gbm              A
Although my heart is falling too
       B 
I'm in love with your body
Dbm        Gbm                  A
  And last night you were in my room
           B                    Dbm
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                 Gbm                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
            B
Well I'm in love with your body
Dbm Gbm A         B
           I'm in love with your body
Dbm Gbm A         B
           I'm in love with your body
Dbm Gbm A         B
           I'm in love with your body
Dbm               Gbm                  A
 Every day discovering something brand new
       B
I'm in love with the shape of you
 
Verse:
Dbm                    Gbm
One week in we let the story begin
            A                B
We're going out on our first date
            Dbm                  Gbm
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
             A                   B
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            Dbm                       Gbm
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             A                B
And how your family is doin' okay
              Dbm               Gbm
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
         A                     B
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Dbm              Gbm
Girl, you know I want your love

A                    B                Dbm
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
