CAPO 1
Intro: 
Am G C F
Verse:
 Am             G              C     F
I thought that I've been hurt before
     Am                 G             C    F
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
 Am             G             C     F
Your words cut deeper than a knife
       Am              G                  F
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Pre-Chorus:

 Am                     G
Got a feeling that I'm going under
 C                    F
But I know that I'll make it out alive
 Am                G
If I quit calling you my lover
 C      F
Move on
Chorus:

              Am                         G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
              C                    F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
              Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
 C               F
I'll be needing stitches
     Am                   G
I'm tripping over myself,
            C                       F
I'm aching begging you to come help
              Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
 C               F
I'll be needing stitches
Verse:

 Am          G               C    F
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
         Am             G                  C   F
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
 Am          G                 C    F
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
               Am             G
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
                 C            F
I'm left seeing red on my own
Bridge:

 Am                     G
Got a feeling that I'm going under
 C                    F
But I know that I'll make it out alive
 Am                G
If I quit calling you my lover
 C      F
Move on
Chorus:

              Am                         G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
              C                    F
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
              Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
 C               F
I'll be needing stitches
     Am                   G
I'm tripping over myself,
            C                       F
I'm aching begging you to come help
              Am               G
And now that I'm without your kisses
 C               F
I'll be needing stitches

 Am
Needle and the thread,
       G
Gotta get you out of my head

I'm shaking, falling onto my knees

I'm aching begging you to come help

I'm without your kisses

I'll be needing stitches
 I'll be needing stitches
