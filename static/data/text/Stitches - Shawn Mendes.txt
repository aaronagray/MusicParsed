Intro: Bbm, Ab, Db, Gb 
 
Verse:
 Bbm             Ab              Db     Gb
 I thought that I've been hurt before
     Bbm                 Ab             Db    Gb  
 But no one's ever left me quite this sore
 Bbm             Ab             Db     Gb
 Your words cut deeper than a knife
       Bbm              Ab                  Gb
 Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
 
Pre-Chorus:
 Bbm                     Ab
 Got a feeling that I'm going under
 Db                    Gb
 But I know that I'll make it out alive
 Bbm                Ab 
 If I quit calling you my lover
 Db      Gb
 Move on
 
Chorus:
              Bbm                         Ab
 You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
              Db                    Gb
 I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
              Bbm               Ab
 And now that I'm without your kisses
 Db               Gb
 I'll be needing stitches
     Bbm                   Ab
 I'm tripping over myself,
            Db                       Gb
 I'm aching begging you to come help
              Bbm               Ab
 And now that I'm without your kisses
 Db               Gb
 I'll be needing stitches
 
Verse:
 Bbm          Ab               Db    Gb
 Just like a moth drawn to a flame
         Bbm             Ab                  Db   Gb  
 Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
 Bbm          Ab                 Db    Gb 
 Your bitter heart cold to the touch
               Bbm             Ab
 Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
                 Db            Gb
 I'm left seeing red on my own
 
Bridge:
 Bbm                     Ab

 Db                    Gb
 But I know that I'll make it out alive
 Bbm                Ab 
 If I quit calling you my lover
 Db      Gb
 Move on
 
Chorus:
              Bbm                         Ab
 You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
              Db                    Gb
 I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
              Bbm               Ab
 And now that I'm without your kisses
