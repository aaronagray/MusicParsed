[Verse]

Fm                        D#
  I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
Fm                         C#
  She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
Fm                 D#
  It's a matter of time before we all run out...
Fm                      C#
  When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
Fm
  I waited eight long months
D#
  She finally set him free
Fm                         C#
  I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Fm                     D#
  Two weeks and we had caught on fire
             Fm                         C#
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

But I got him where I want him now
C#2               G#                     D#
  Whoa... it was never my intention to brag
   Fm             D#
To steal it all away from you now
C#2                          D#
  But God does it feel so good

'Cause I got him where I want him now
C#2                                   D#
  And if you could then you know you would

'Cause God it just feels so...

Fm                           D#
  Second chances: they don't ever matter, people never change
Fm                             C#
  Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
Fm                      D#
  And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
Fm                         C#
  I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way
Fm                             D#
  Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Fm                       C#
  Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
Fm                                   D#
  They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Fm                    C#
   Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!
