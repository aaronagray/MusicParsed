[Verse]

           C                 Am
Now do ya hear me talking to you
           Dm7                G        E7
Across the water, across the deep blue ocean
           Am         Dm7
Under the open sky, oh my
          G
Baby I'm trying


[Verse]

           C                 Am
Boy I hear you in my dreams
           Dm7                G        
I feel your whisper across the sea
           E7            Am
I keep you with me in my heart
            Dm7         G         G#dim
You make it easier when life gets hard


[Chorus]

Am           Dm7                G
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
                C       C/B     Am
Lucky to have been where I have been
            Dm7         Gsus4  G
Lucky to be coming home again
C      Am      Em       G
Ooooh ooh-oooooh ooh-ooooooh....


[Bridge]

Dm7        Am               G
They don't know how long it takes
              Dm7
Waiting for a love like this
      Am              G                  Dm7
Every time we say goodbye, I wish we had one more kiss
                     Am              G   Am7 C/B  
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will


[Chorus]

Am        Dm7                  G
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
          C                C/B  Am
Lucky to have been where I have been
            Dm7          Gsus4  G   
Lucky to be coming home again
Am          Dm7              G
Lucky we're in love in every way
         C                C/B      Am
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
            Dm7              Gsus4  G 
Lucky to be coming home some day
            

[Verse]

           C                    Am
And so I'm sailing, through the sea
      Dm7                 G
To an island, where we'll meet
                E7              Am
You'll hear the music, fill the air
        Dm7      G
I put a flower in you hair

               C                   Am
And though the breezes through the trees
        Dm7                  G
Move so pretty, you're all I see
        E7                  Am
As the world keep spinning round
    Dm7             G
You hold me right here, right now

Am           Dm7                G
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
                C       C/B     Am
Lucky to have been where I have been
            Dm7         G
Lucky to be coming home again
Am           Dm7                G
Lucky we're in love in every way
         C                 C/B     Am
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
            Dm7         G
Lucky to be coming home some day
C        Am          Em  G       C
oooooh oooh-oooooooh ooooh-ooooh.
