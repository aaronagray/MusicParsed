[Intro]
                                 Am
Well can't you see that it's just raining?
                          G
There ain't no need to go outside.
    D7
But Baby!

[Verse]

    G           D7
You hardly even know this
Am            C7 
when I try to show you
G                D7
Song is meant to keep you
     Am                C7
from doing what you're supposed to
G            D7
wakin' up to early
Am             C7
maybe we could sleep
G               D7
make you banana pancakes
Am                   C7
pretend like it's the weekend


[Chorus]

Am
now
                            G    G7
we could pretend it all the time.
                            Am
Can't you see that it's just raining.
                      G  G7
Ain't no need to go outside.
         D7
But just maybe!


[Verse]

G          D7    Am            C7 
Hala ka ukulele, mama made a baby.
G                           D7    Am            C7 
Really don't mind to practice cause you're my little lady.
G          D7                 Am            C7 
Lady lady love me cause I love to lay you lazy.
G          D7                    Am                C7 
We could close the curtains pretend like theres no world


[Chorus]

Am
outside.
                                  G    G7
Then we could pretend it all the time.
                            Am
cant you see that it's just raining,
                     G
Ain't no need to go outside.

                         Am
Ain't no need Ain't no need.
                     G
mmmm  mmmm  mmmmm  mmmmm
                        Am
Can't you see can't you see?
                           G
Rain all day and I don't mind.


[Bridge]

Am                                                             D
But the telephones singin ringin it's too early dont pick it up.
 D
We don't need to
       Am                                                             D
we got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough.
D
just so easy
         Bm
When the whole world fit's inside of your arms
      Em                           C
do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
             G         D7
wake up slow,  mmmmm mmmmmm
             G
wake up slow


[Verse]

G         D7  
But Baby!
Am            C7 
You hardly even know this
G             D7  
when I try to show you
G                  D7           Am                 C7 
Song is meant to keep you from doing what you're supposed to.


G          D7 
Wakin' up to early
Am            C7 
maybe we could sleep
G          D7

[Chorus]

Am

                                  G    G7
Then we could pretend it all the time.

cant you see that it's just raining,
                    G    G7
Ain't no need to go outside.

Am                      G
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind.
                         Am
