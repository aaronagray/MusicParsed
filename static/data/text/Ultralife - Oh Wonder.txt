[Verse 1]

Dm           C              G
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Dm             C            G
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
F         C           G
Lights out solo in the blue
      Dm        C   G
Before I found you

[Pre-Chorus]

Dm          F       C        G
Days passed slowly, lost and low
    Dm      F        C           G
You gave me hope and now there's only

[Chorus]

Dm                  C
Blood running in my veins
                G
I've never been here before
          Dm                   C
And I got love falling like the rain
                 G
I never could've asked for more
      F              Am
I got so much soul inside my bones
G                   C/E
  Take a look at me now
    Dm                   C
I'm young forever in the sun
           G
Ever since you came 
                  Dm  C  G  G
I'm living ultralife
                  Dm  C  G G
I'm living ultralife
                  Dm  C  G G
I'm living ultralife

[Verse 2]

Dm            C               G
Turn down the voice inside my head
                  Dm
Cause heaven only knows
       C              G
Why we feel this emptiness
           Dm         C            G
But I will climb out, find another view
         Dm       C  G
Now I've found you

[Pre-Chorus]

Dm          F       C        G
Days passed slowly, lost and low
    Dm      F        C           G
You gave me hope and now there's only

[Chorus]

Dm                  C
Blood running in my veins
                G
I've never been here before
          Dm                    C
And I got love falling like the rain
                 G
I never could've asked for more
      F              Am
I got so much soul inside my bones
G                   C/E
  Take a look at me now
    Dm                   C
I'm young forever in the sun
           G
Ever since you came I'm living ultralife
F                  G
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me
F                  G
Ultralife with me, ultralife with me

[Bridge]

F                        C/E
Found me on a basement floor
G                         C/E
Back when I had lost it all
F                            C/E
Told me what the fight was for
G                       C/E  F
And I'm not giving up no   more
                      C/E
You elevate the life in me
G                     C/E
Illuminate the in-between
F                         C/E
Forever gonna feel this free
G                       C/E
And I'm not giving up now

[Verse 1]

Dm           C              G
Lovesick the beat inside my head
Dm             C            G
Waves struck a sea of bitterness
Dm         C           G
Lights out solo in the blue
         Dm        C   G
Before I found you

[Chorus]

Dm                  C
Blood running in my veins
                G
I've never been here before
          Dm                    C
And I got love falling like the rain
                 G
I never could've asked for more
      F              Am
I got so much soul inside my bones
G                   C/E
  Take a look at me now
    Dm                   C
I'm young forever in the sun
           G
Ever since you came 
                  Dm  C  G
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
                  Dm  C  G
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
                   Dm  C  G
We're living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
                   Dm  C  G
We're living ultralife
(Ultralife with me, ultralife with me)
                  N.C.
I'm living ultralife
(Ultralife with me)
