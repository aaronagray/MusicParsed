CAPO 1
[Intro/Chorus]

                    B♭sus2
I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Csus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Dm                   Dm            Dm   Csus4
Oh, God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B♭sus2                     Csus4                        Dm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
[Verse 1]

           B♭sus2              Csus4
How do you feel, that is the question
       Dm               Dm            Dm   Csus4
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
       B♭sus2                          Csus4
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
           Dm               Dm                      Dm   Csus4
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
                 B♭sus2                Csus4
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
  Dm                                  Dm   Csus4
Remember what you're staring at is me
[Chorus]

B♭sus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Csus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Dm                   Dm                    Csus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B♭sus2                     Csus4                        Dm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 2]
           B♭sus2              Csus4
How much is real? So much to question
       Dm               Dm            Dm   Csus4
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
       B♭sus2                          Csus4
And if that came from the heart it never did, right from the start
           Dm               Dm                      Dm   Csus4
Just listen to the noises (No more silent voices)
                B♭sus2                Csus4
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
 Dm                                  Dm   Csus4
Remember it's just different from what you've seen
[Chorus]

B♭sus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Csus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Dm                   Dm                    Csus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B♭sus2                     Csus4                        Dm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
B♭sus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Csus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Dm                   Dm                    Csus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B♭sus2                     Csus4                        Dm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
[Bridge]

             B♭sus2       Csus4       Dm
And it's the stars, the stars, that shine for you
             B♭sus2       Csus4       Dm
And it's the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah
[Chorus]

B♭sus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Csus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Dm                   Dm                    Csus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B♭sus2                     Csus4                        Dm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
B♭sus2
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                    Csus4
Don't know how much time has passed
            Dm                   Dm                    Csus4
All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B♭sus2                     Csus4                        Dm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
[Ending]

             B♭sus2       Csus4       Dm
And it's the stars, the stars, that shine for you
             B♭sus2       Csus4       Dm
And it's the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah
             B♭sus2       Csus4       Dm
And it's the stars, the stars, that shine for you
             B♭sus2       Csus4       Dm
And it's the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah
              B♭sus2
Oh, we're the stars
              Csus4       Dm
Oh, we're the stars that lie
