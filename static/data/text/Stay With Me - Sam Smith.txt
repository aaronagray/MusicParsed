Verse:
Bm                       G             D
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
Bm               G                  D
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
Bm                 G          D
These nights never seem to go to plan
Bm                  G                   D
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
 
Chorus:
         Bm    G    D
Won't you stay with me?
           Bm    G D
Cause you're all I need
          Bm         G        D
This ain't love it's clear to see
    A        Bm   G    D
But darling, stay with me
 
Verse:
Bm       G   D
Why am I so emotional?
Bm                 G               D
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Bm              G            D
And deep down I know this never works
Bm                   G            D
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

This ain't love it's clear to see

But darling, stay with me
