[Chorus]
C                             D                            Em           G
Maybe you don't have to rush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place.
C                              D                            Em           G         C
We don't need to keep it hush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my pla-ace.

[Verse 1]
                  D
  Stuck in a limbo, half hypnotized
Em                     G
  Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night (aah oooh)
C                   D
  Up in the morning, tangled in sheets
Em                   G
  We play the moment on repeat, on repeat  (aah ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
            C                       D
When you're standing there, in your underwear
       Em                     G
And my T-shirt from the night before
          C                       D
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare,
          Em                  G
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?  (Aah oooh)

[Chorus]
C                             D                            Em           G
Maybe you don't have to rush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place.
C                              D                            Em           G         C
We don't need to keep it hush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my pla-ace.
          D
I just, I just can't let you go, you
Em            G
  Give me something I've never known 
   C                             D                          Em           G         C
So maybe you don't have to rush, you can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my pla-ace.

[Verse 2]
                    D
No need to question, next time we meet
Em                     G
  I know you're coming home with me, home with me (aah oooh)
C                    D
  Sweat like a sauna, break out the ice 
Em                    G
  I know you're gonna stay the night, stay the night (aah oooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
            C                       D
When you're standing there, in your underwear
       Em                     G
And my T-shirt from the night before
          C                       D
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare,
          Em                  G
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?  (Aah oooh)

[Chorus]
C                             D                            Em           G
Maybe you don't have to rush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place.
C                              D                            Em           G         C
We don't need to keep it hush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my pla-ace.
          D
I just, I just can't let you go, you
Em            G
  Give me something I've never known 
   C                             D                          Em           G        
So maybe you don't have to rush, you can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place.

[Bridge]
  C          D
I don't want this to end
            Em          G
And there's no need to play pretend 
       C         D
If you stay with me again
          Em
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?    Aah oooh

[Chorus]
C                             D                            Em           G
Maybe you don't have to rush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place.
C                              D                            Em           G         C
We don't need to keep it hush, you could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my pla-ace.
          D
I just, I just can't let you go, you
Em            G
  Give me something I've never known 
   C                             D                          Em           G         C
So maybe you don't have to rush, you can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my pla-ace.
