[Verse 1]
Fm            Db               Bb
Looking at me through your window
         Fm               Db       Bb
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
      Fm              Db         Bb
"I'll cut you up and make you dinner
        Fm                  Db        C7
You've reached the end, you are the winner"

Fm                 Db        Bb
Rolling down your tinted window
Fm              Db         Bb
Driving next to me real slow, he said
Fm                Db       Bb
"Let me take you for a joyride
Fm                  Db         C7
I've got some candy for you inside"


[Chorus]
Fm                  Db
Running through the parking lot
    Eb            Bb
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Fm          Db   Eb                Bb
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Fm               Db
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Eb                    Bb
Took the words right out my mouth
Fm          Db   Eb                Bb
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
    Fm      Db            Eb             Bb
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
    Fm      Db             Eb            Bb
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
        Fm           Db   Eb                Bb
Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
              Fm          Db   Eb                Bb
He's saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"


[Verse 2]
Fm            Db         Bb
Little bit of poison in me
Fm               Db           Bb
I can taste your skin in my teeth
   Fm             Db            Bb
"I love it when I hear you breathing
  Fm                 Db        C7
I hope to God you're never leaving"


[Chorus]
Fm                  Db
Running through the parking lot
    Eb            Bb
He chased me and he wouldn't stop

Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Fm               Db
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Eb                    Bb
Took the words right out my mouth
Fm          Db   Eb                Bb
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
    Fm      Db            Eb             Bb
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
    Fm      Db             Eb            Bb
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?

Saying, "tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
