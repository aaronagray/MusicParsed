[Verse 1]

E
  I watched the proverbial sunrise
A2
  coming up over the Pacific and
C#m
  you might think I'm losing my mind,
B2
  but I will shy away from the specifics...
A2                            B2         C#m
  'cause I don't want you to know where I am
          A2                  B2
  'cause then you'll see my heart
          C#m
  in the saddest state it's ever been.
A2                    B2
  This is no place to try and live my life.


[Pre-Chorus]

E              E5            B2             B/D#
  Stop right there. That's exactly where I lost it.
A2          C#m          B2
  See that line. Well I never should have crossed it.
E              E5           B2               B/D#
  Stop right there. Well I never should have said
                 A/Ab        A2
  that it's the very moment that
     B2
  I wish that I could take back.


[Chorus]

E                     C#        B      
  I'm sorry for the person I became.
E                   C#               B                      
  I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change.
E                            C#               B      
  I'm ready to - to try and never become that way again
C#          B - C#         E          A2
  'cause who I am hates who I've been.
        B2                (Intro)
  Who I am hates who I've been.


[Verse 2]

E
  I talk to absolutely no one.
A2
  Couldn't keep to myself enough.
            C#m
  And the things bottled inside have finally begun
       B2
  to create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up.
E
  I heard the reverberating footsteps
A2
  sinking up to the beating of my heart,
C#m                                B2
  and I was positive that unless I got myself together,

  I would watch me fall apart.
      A2               B2       C#m
  And I can't let that happen again
          A2                 B2
  'cause then you'll see my heart
         C#m
  in the saddest state it's ever been.
A                    B2
  This is no place to try and live my life.


[Pre-Chorus]

E              E5            B2             B/D#
  Stop right there. That's exactly where I lost it.
A2          C#m          B2
  See that line. Well I never should have crossed it.
E              E5           B2               B/D#
  Stop right there. Well I never should have said
                 A/Ab        A2
  that it's the very moment that
     B2
  I wish that I could take back.

E              E5            B2             B/D#
  Stop right there. That's exactly where I lost it.
A2          C#m          B2
  See that line. Well I never should have crossed it.
E              E5           B2               B/D#
  Stop right there. Well I never should have said
                 A/Ab        A2
  that it's the very moment that
     B2
  I wish that I could take back.


[Chorus]

E/G#      A2                B2
  Who I am hates who I've been
                                                B2/C       C#m
  and who I am won't take the second chance you gave me.
         A2                   E 
  Who I am hates who I've been
                        B2
  'cause who I've been only ever made me...
E                                   B2  C#m
  So sorry for the person I became.
                                                  B2 E
  So sorry that it took so long for me to change.
                                                B2  C#m
  I'm ready to try and never become that way again
                                  A2
  'cause who I am hates who I've been.
           B2                
  Who I am hates who I've been.
