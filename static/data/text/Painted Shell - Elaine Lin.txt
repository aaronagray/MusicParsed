[Intro]
   Fsus2           Gsus4
An ode to my dead ED
    Am                 C
How badly did you hurt me?
        Fsus2    Gsus4
I spent over ten years
            Am         C
With slight hunger and fears
     Fsus2        Gsus4 Am   C
That no one would ever  love me 

[Verse 1]
C
Do you know me?
G
What do you see?
Am
A pretty girl
F
Happy as can be

C
Warm smile so bright 
Gsus4
Laughter so light
Am
But you can’t see
Fsus2              Fsus2 Fsus2
The internal fight 

[Chorus]
        Fsus2  
Because I wear a mask
            Gsus4
It’s just a painted shell
    Am
And no one knows that
   C
It hurts like hell

Fsus2
I wear a mask
           Gsus4
It’s just a painted shell
    Am
And no one knows that
   C
It hurts like hell
Fsus2 Gsus4 Am C C

[Verse 2]
C
Try to leave home
G
Exposed, alone
Am
Where do I go?
F
Can’t find a new one

C
Paint chips and tears
Gsus4
A thin veneer 
Am
No place to go
Fsus2              Fsus2 Fsus2
Alone, I stay here

[Chorus]
Fsus2
Wearing a mask
           Gsus4
It’s just a painted shell
    Am
And no one knows that
   C
It hurts like hell

Fsus2
Wearing a mask
           Gsus4
It’s just a painted shell
    Am
And no one knows that
   C
It hurts like hell
Fsus2 Gsus4 Am C

[Bridge]
   Am
It sucked out my happiness and
F
Stripped away my confidence
   C
It sucked out my happiness and
G
Stripped away my confidence

[Verse 3]
C            G
But now it’s dead
Am            F
Yes, now it’s dead
C            G
I killed the monster 
Am        F    F  F
All in my head

[Chorus]
         F
Now, the shell is my home
    G
And I am alone
    Am
And no one knows that
   C
It hurts like hell
F G Am C
         F
Yes, the shell is my home
    G
And I am alone
    Am
And no one knows that
   C
It hurts like hell
