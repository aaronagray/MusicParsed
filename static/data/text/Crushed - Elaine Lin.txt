[Verse 1]
D A F♯m E
My mind’s a room
I used to be
Crushed in a corner
By boxes big and small

[Verse 2]
D A F♯m E
Then, one by one
I looked inside
Found fear and worry
So I moved them out

[Instrumental]
D A F♯m E
E B G♯m F♯

[Bridge]
E B G♯m F♯
It’s an empty room.
A lonely room.
Now I’m in an empty room.
A lonely room.

[Verse 3]
E B G♯m F♯
But it’s my home
Yes, it's my home
Not crushed in a corner
So I can freely roam.
