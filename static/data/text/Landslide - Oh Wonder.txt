[Intro x2]

Dm C A# F

[Verse 1]

   Dm              C
I know it hurts sometimes but
  A#             F
You'll get over it
             Dm              C
You'll find another life to live
        A#              F
I know you'll get over it
   Dm                  C
I know you're sad and tired
            A#               F
You've got nothing left to give
                 Dm              C
But you'll find another life to live
   A#                   F
I know you'll get over it


[Chorus]

                Dm            C
So when you're caught in a landslide
           F                     A#
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
            Dm              C
And in the rain, give you sunshine
           F                     A#
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
           Dm                C
And every time that you're lonely
        F                       A#
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
          Dm                      C
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
           F                A#
I'll be there for you, you know

       Dm                  C
And I know you feel like everything
     A#             F
Is falling to the wind
              Dm              C
But don't you let the thunder in
              A#               F
Cause I know you'll get over it

[Bridge]

A#             F
You fell down by the wayside
 C               Dm
Love locked in an overflow
A#                   F
And you threw stones at the starlight
 C                     Dm
Cause I stood on the sidelines telling you
A#                      F
That I get that you're lonely
  C                     Dm
And I see that you feel alone
   A#               F
But I heard in a heartbeat
           C                     A#
I'll be there here for you, you know


[Chorus]

                Dm            C
So when you're caught in a landslide
           F                     A#
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
            Dm              C
And in the rain, give you sunshine
           F                     A#
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
           Dm                C
And every time that you're lonely
        F                       A#
Every time that you're feeling low, you should know
          Dm                      C
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
