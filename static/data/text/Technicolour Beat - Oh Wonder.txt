CAPO 1
[Verse]

Am              Em
Lay down your sword
     D                         C
Come settle down, settle down
Am              Em
Let loose your glow
     D                         C
Come settle down, settle down
   Am                   C
And I feel life for the very first time,
Em                        D
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
Am                 C
I feel safe in the 5am light
 Em                        D                  
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                       Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am
In a Technicolour beat
            C
You & me...
G                      Em
Caught up in a dream
D                 C          Em
In a Technicolour beat, beat, beat, beat


[Verse]

Am         Em
Warm and alone
      D                        C
Come settle down, settle down
Am               Em
Swing me your bones
      D                        C
Come settle down, settle down
   Am                   C
And I feel life for the very first time,
Em                        D
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
Am                 C
I feel safe in the 5am light
 Em                        D               
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire
[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                       Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am
In a Technicolour beat
            C
You & me...
G                      Em
Caught up in a dream
D                 C           
In a Technicolour beat, beat

[Bridge]

Am                  G
Give me one drop, I can feel you
D                   C
Make me lose control
Am               G
We be walking on the water,
D                                 
Weâ€™re moving in a Technicolour beat,
Moving in a Technicolour 

[Chorus]

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
(Falling off the ceiling)
G                     Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am       
(Moving) in a Technicolour beat 
           C
You & me,
(Found another feeling)
G                     Em
Caught up in a dream,
D                  C         
(Moving) in a Technicolour beat

Am                  C
Jump into the heat
G                     Em
Spinning on our feet
D                      Am       
(Moving) in a Technicolour beat 
           C
You & me,
G                     Em
Caught up in a dream,
D                  C         
(Moving) in a Technicolour beat, beat, beat
